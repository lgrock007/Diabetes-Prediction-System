# DIABETES PREDICTION SYSTEM

Description:
Developing a diabetes prediction system using machine learning involves creating a model that can accurately classify whether a patient has diabetes based on certain input features. This system can assist healthcare professionals in early diagnosis and intervention for diabetes management. By leveraging supervised learning classification algorithms, the model learns patterns from historical data to make predictions on new, unseen data. The system should provide accurate predictions while being user-friendly and interpretable.
